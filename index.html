    <h2 class="subheader">About Me</h2>

    <p>I am a devoted scholar studying Application Development at Seattle Central College through YearUp. I'm passionate
      about building and developing softwares that will enhance user experience. My empathetic nature allows me to gain
      personal satisfaction by making a difference in peoples lives. I am eager to start building my professional brand
      in the technology industry and network with professionals.</p>

    <p>I gained a Bachelors degree in Political Science and Communications at WWU and received a Web Development
      certificate through NuCamp. I am constantly looking for ways to grow and develop new skills. I have a proven
      critical thinking ability to solve complex issues and effectively build trust and credibility with individuals I
      collaborate with.</p>

    <p>In the YearUp program, I have been learning various coding languages such as HTML, CSS and Javascript. I'm also
      gaining in demand skills such as Microsoft Office, advanced excel, version control systems, cloud databases and
      business communication skills.</p>

    <p>In my future professional career, I plan on innovating opportunities for the underprivileged population to become
      sufficient by providing resources where they can gain in demand skills and elevate as individuals. I'm interested
      in creating strong connections with like minded individuals who strive to make a difference.</p>
